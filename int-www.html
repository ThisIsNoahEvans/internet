  <h2>Nowadays, when talking about going online, people typically say "I'll look on the internet." However, that is not strictly true. When you search for something using a search engine like Google, you are using both the Internet and the World Wide Web at the same time.</h2>
  <h3>The Internet is a worldwide network of networks. It is the computers, servers, and other hardware to link the "digital world" together. The World Wide Web, however, is simply the websites you view using the Internet. A search engine, like Google, is a website on the World Wide Web that allows you to find other websites. Google, and these other websites, are on the internet - they are stored on the servers that "power" the internet. The actual pages that are served are websites, on the World Wide Web.</h3>
