  <h2>Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is a very famous person. But what was his life before he created the web?</h2>
  <h3>Timothty John Berners-Le was born on the 8th June 1955. He grew up in London and studied Physics at Oxford. He worked at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory, in 1989 when he first described the concept of a global system that was based on the concept of Hypertext. It would allow researchers anywhere to share information. In 1989, he published a paper called "Information Management: A Proposal" where he linked the Internet to Hypertext, creating a system for sharing information globally - not just inside a company. He decided to name it the World Wide Web, or WWW for short - hence a lot of URLs begin with www.yourcompany.com.</h3>
