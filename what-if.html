  <h1>What if the World Wide Web wasn't free for everyone to use?</h1>

  <h2>The World Wide Web is free for everyone to use, providing they can connect to it. Companies like ISPs and mobile phone carriers charge for access to the service, but the service itself is free. You don't pay a monthly World Wide Web bill - you pay a monthly bill to connect to the Internet. But what would the web be like if you had to pay to visit a website?</h2>
  <h3>There are many ways that it could be paid. From a single payment to access all websites to a payment per website, nobody knows what the World Wide Web would have been like if it had been paid. Sir Tim Berners-Lee released the World Wide Web as a free service to everyone, and with that simple act, changed the world as we know it. The web would have been just as amazing technologically if it was paid - but it wouldn't have changed nearly as many people's lives. The fact that anyone can set up a website, an "internet company", or a service online, means that the internet will likely thrive forever. If you had to pay to use the World Wide Web as a service, it would not have nearly as many users or uses. Many companies, such as Google and Facebook, were born out of colleges when students who had an idea launched a website. If the web was controlled by big corporations, many companies and services we take for granted wouldn't exist. Imagine if you had to prepare a pitch just to create a website, like this one!</h3>
