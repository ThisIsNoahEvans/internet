  <h1>How to Write a Webpage</h1>

  <h3>Webpages, like this one, are made using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JS</strong>. HTML <i>(Hypertext Markup Language)</i> is the code of actual site - text, buttons, and basic layout. CSS <i>(Cascading Style Sheets)</i> is the language used for the style of a website - for example, the font, colours, backgrounds, and size of objects. It is not required for a site to function as HTML (usually) is, however is used on almost all websites. JS <i>(JavaScript)</i> is not required in a website, and can even be disabled in some browsers. It is used for things like animations, special buttons and message boxes, and interactive parts of a site. Without it, sites would be static (like this one.) </h4>
  <h2>How can I write a webpage?</h3>
  <h3>You can write websites using these languages yourself. Open a code editor like Atom, create a .html, .css, or .js file and start coding! When opening your HTML file in a browser, you will see the pages that you have coded. HTML uses tags - these are strings inside <> that tell your browser what the text is, or if it's a bit of code. For exmaple, < h1> is the tag for a heading of the largest size. For smaller sizes, simply lower the number after the "h" - you can go all the way down to 6 for the smallest heading. < p> is also a tag, for standard size text. There are many others, such as < small> for, well, small text, and < a> for links​​​​​​. All websites are developed this way, but most use CSS and JS - until you master these, your websites will just be plain text! If you really want to experiment, search for "html website templates" and download one. Open the folder in your code editor and look through the code - it'll be different and more advanced, but you'll be able to start editing in no time. There are also programs like <a href='https://mobirise.com/'>Mobirise</a>, which allow you to create websites from visual templates and cues - like sites such as Wix or Google Sites - but export your site as HTML, CSS, and JS files. These files can then be uploaded to a hosting service (explained below) so you can get a beautiful website easily - whilst still getting the knowledge of HTML by viewing and manually editing the code to your liking.</h3>
  <h2>Okay, so how do I get it on the internet?</h2>
  <h3>If you want your new website to be on the internet, you'll need <strong>hosting</strong>. Hosting is simple - your website files are hosted on a server somewhere in the world, and a domain is pointed to that server. A domain is like a web address, but is simply yourdomain.com rather than www.yourdomain.com or shop.yourdomain.com. You can buy domains from many companies, such as <a href='https://godaddy.com'>GoDaddy</a>, <a href='https://domains.google'>Google</a>, and <a href='https://namecheap.com'>Namecheap</a>. These companies will charge you a yearly price for your domain. Once you have your domain, you can link it to a hosting service. These can also typically cost, but there are some free ones. <a href='https://repl.it'>Repl.it</a> is one such provider, however their service is not as flexible as some others. <a href='https://pages.github.com'>GitHub</a>, the open-source platform for developers, offer a service called GitHub Pages. This allows you to either write text for your websites in <a href='https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/'>Markdown</a>, or, as we've already gone over, using HTML, CSS, and JS. Once you have your site finished, upload it to a repository and enable GitHub Pages. You'll have to add a type of record called a CNAME to your DNS (domain name system) settings on the website of the company you bought your domain from, and then GitHub will serve your site at your domain for free! Also be aware that the 'www.' at the beginning of a website's URL is not overly common nowdays - as sites can be published on the root domain, and subdomains have been utilised to take the empty space for where the 'www' is not present. For example, the root domain of this website is itsnoahevans.co.uk, but the site is hosted on "web.itsnoahevans.co.uk". The web part is a subdomain. If you're going to host your website at yourdomain.com, make sure that www.yourdomain.com redirects to yourdomain.com. There's a lot more to hosting, but that's the simple explanation.</h3?
